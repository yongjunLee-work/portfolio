                <p>Last-Mile Delivery Robot / Perovskite-Solar-Cell / HKNU-Design The Greatest Design Award 2022</p>
                <p>Ddingdong aims to solve the 'delivery cost burden' for caterers and consumers by using a perovskite solar cell delivery robot to enhance sustainability and reduce labor costs. 
                    <br>As an 'autonomous driving food delivery robot' that utilizes pedestrian roads and less crowded back roads in complex urban areas, it offers Last Mile Food Delivery Robotics as a Service (RaaS).

                    During my junior year at university, I spent a semester deeply engaged in studying Service Design and Experience Design. This coursework sparked my interest in user-centered design, as it emphasized not only functional aspects but also aesthetic elements, usability, and emotional satisfaction.
                    In the second semester of my junior year, I participated in a multidisciplinary project on Perovskite Solar Cells, which involved collaboration between the Design, Business Administration, and Chemical Engineering departments. This project required an in-depth understanding of knowledge from both Business Administration and Chemical Engineering to achieve effective design outcomes. The collaborative efforts across these three disciplines culminated in a successful and innovative solution.
